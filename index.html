                        <br> At contrary to our competitor   <a href="https://www.h2mat.com/"  id ="test"> H2mat </a>  we do recycling !


                        <p>
                          A mattress takes over 100 years to degrade if you leave it in the wild! So, if your mattress is no longer in good condition, its ticking is stained, or if its springs are tired, don't leave it in nature!
                        </p>  

                        <p>
                          The same is true for bulky items since most of the time these services do not properly recycle the deposited waste, which sometimes all ends up in the incinerator.
                        </p>
                      
                        <br>
                        Your mattress may, depending on the community, be recycled. Indeed, it will only be if the recycling center has a dumpster dedicated to used furniture. Otherwise, it will unfortunately end up burned!
                        Avoid this option and let us recover your mattresses to give them a second life.
